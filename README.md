# MongoDB Cloud Adapter
Work in progress project for implementating an Oracle Cloud Adapter for MongoDB. For more information see my [blog](http://ninckblokje.github.io).

This is my first go (actually the third) at the Oracle Cloud Adapter SDK. The code is a mess, I hope to fix this after completing it.
